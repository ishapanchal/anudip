<p>Who says you have to do it all by yourself? Think of this as a time to lead with your heart and to connect with your fellow unicorns. 
A time to dream up a new world into being and to take inspired action. A time to make magic in collaboration with Spirit knowing that every step in 
the right direction counts. PS: Something tells us it’s all coming together for you in the most unexpected manner.

Cosmic tip: Give yourself the permission to lean on your soul crew at this time.</p>

<p>There’s many things you like about them, but the way they get along with your tribe certainly tops the list. Just a reminder: wearing your heart on 
your sleeve is not a crime, beautiful. So, if you feel like there is potential here, don’t be afraid to express your big feelings or have a conversation 
about the future you envision with them. But, it’s not just about romantic affairs in the Taurus sanctuary. Spending time with your soul crew is also a 
priority. Consider bringing your best friends together if you haven’t done that in a while.

Cosmic tip: Consider bringing the crew together today.</p>

<p>We get it, Gemini. You want to get to that place where everything feels safe and secure. But right now, your spiritual lesson is to stay in your 
centre despite the chaos. To trust that the uncertainty too is a gift and that things are working out in your favour. What could feel like a 
challenge: differentiating between your intuition and paranoia. So, cultivate stillness. Connect with your spirit guides. The answers you are seeking 
will find you when you aren’t looking.

Cosmic tip: The answers you are seeking will find you unexpectedly.</p>
